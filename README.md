# Bike-Sharing Demand Analysis
This is done by Yunjing Yao, Zihan Liu and Sianna Fang

This repository contains code to analyze bike-sharing demand across multiple cities, with a focus on understanding the impact of weather conditions, time of day, and city-specific trends.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    git clone https://github.com/GuoZheXinDeGuang/CSCI-381-Final-Project.git and
    cd CSCI-381-Final-Project

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. **Load the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `Final_Group_Project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run the cells in sequence to execute the analysis.

2. **Run the analysis**:
   - The notebook includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), weather impact analysis, and visualization of results.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset, handling missing values and extracting key features like the hour of the day.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data to uncover trends and patterns in bike rental behavior across different times and conditions.

3. **Weather Impact Analysis**: Analyzes the relationship between weather conditions (e.g., temperature) and bike rental demand.

4. **City-Specific Insights**: Examines rental patterns unique to each city, providing targeted recommendations for optimization.

5. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Develops and evaluates predictive models to forecast bike rental demand, utilizing features like weather, time, and location.
